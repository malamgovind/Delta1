      <p> now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this sun of york; and all the clouds that lours
         our house in the deep bosom of the ocean buried. now are our brows bound with bictorious wreaths; our bruised
         arms hung up for monuments our stern alarmus changed to merry meetings out dreadful marches to delightful
         measures. Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;</p>
